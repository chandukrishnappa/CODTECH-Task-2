OBJECTIVE: This project is to build an IIoT system for predictive maintenance in industrial settings, leveraging sensors and machine learning algorithms to monitor equipment health, detect anomalies, and schedule maintenance proactively to prevent downtime. KEY ACTIVITIES: Data Acquisition and Integration: Sensor Data Collection: Set up data collection from sensors using protocols like Modbus, OPC UA, or proprietary protocols. Edge Computing: Implement edge computing solutions to preprocess data locally if necessary. Data Transmission: Ensure reliable data transmission from sensors to central servers using MQTT, HTTP, or other protocols. Data Storage and Management: Database Selection: Choose a suitable database (SQL, NoSQL, or time-series database like InfluxDB) for storing sensor data. Schema Design: Design a database schema to efficiently store and retrieve sensor data. Data Ingestion: Implement data ingestion pipelines to store incoming sensor data in the database. Data Processing and Analytics Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise and handle missing values. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from raw sensor data for machine learning models. Model Development: Develop machine learning models (e.g., anomaly detection, predictive maintenance) using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Model Training: Train models on historical data and validate their performance. Real-time Monitoring and Anomaly Detection Model Deployment: Deploy trained machine learning models to production for real-time inference. Real-time Data Processing: Set up real-time data processing pipelines using tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, or similar. Dashboard Development: Create dashboards to visualize real-time sensor data, anomalies, and predictive maintenance insights using tools like Grafana, Kibana, or custom web applications. Alerting System: Set up alerting systems (email, SMS, etc.) to notify maintenance teams of potential issues. TECHNOLOGIES USED: Sensors and Hardware: Accelerometers (vibration) Thermocouples (temperature) Strain gauges (pressure) Raspberry Pi or Arduino for data acquisition Edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson for local processing Data Acquisition and Integration: MQTT protocol for data transmission Node-RED for data integration LoRaWAN for long-range wireless communication Data Storage: InfluxDB for time-series data MongoDB for NoSQL storage AWS S3 for cloud storage Data Processing and Machine Learning: Python with Pandas and NumPy for data processing Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for machine learning Jupyter Notebooks for model development Real-time Monitoring and Anomaly Detection: Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming Isolation Forest for anomaly detection TensorFlow Serving for real-time model inference Visualization and Alerts: Grafana for dashboards Flask for custom web applications Twilio for SMS alerts Deployment: Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration AWS for cloud infrastructure Security: TLS/SSL for secure data transmission AWS IAM for authentication and authorization
